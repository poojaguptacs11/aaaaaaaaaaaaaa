== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are the share buttons not aligned properly ? =

Share buttons are aligned using CSS. This alignment can sometimes be disturbed by the active theme used. This can be corrected by CSS. Please refer [this image](https://goo.gl/Ge7riC#css-classes) for the list of CSS classes used by plugin to modify it or else please post your issue in the [support forum](https://goo.gl/BXkcjA) I'll try my best to give a quick CSS fix for the misalignment.

= Share buttons are not displayed in the page ! =

Share buttons or other feature may be hidden if the option "Hide in all pages" option is selected in "Conditions to display" section. Please select "Show in all pages" option to display the buttons. If the buttons are still not displayed, please raise an issue in the Support forum.

= How to disable a feature in specific page alone ? = 

WP Socializer has a feature called "conditional display" where a feature can be made to shown only at desired places by creating rules. Please look for the section "Conditions to display the template" under every feature page to add rules as per the requirement.
